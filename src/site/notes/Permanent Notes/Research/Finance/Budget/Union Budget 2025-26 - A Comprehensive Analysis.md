# Union Budget 2025-26: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

The Union Budget 2025-26, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, lays out the Indian government's financial roadmap for the upcoming fiscal year. Aimed at "accelerating growth, securing inclusive development, invigorating private sector investments, uplifting household sentiments, and enhancing the spending power of India’s rising middle class" [43], the budget seeks to propel India towards its long-term vision of becoming a 'Viksit Bharat' (Developed India) by 2047 [54].

This report provides a detailed analysis of the budget, covering key aspects such as overall financial performance, departmental allocations, taxation policies, and its anticipated impact on various sectors and the citizens of India. It also examines the budget's alignment with long-term economic goals and identifies potential challenges and opportunities.

## Budget Overview

The total receipts other than borrowings are estimated at ₹34.96 lakh crore, while the total expenditure is projected at ₹50.65 lakh crore [1]. Net tax receipts are estimated to be ₹28.37 lakh crore [1]. The fiscal deficit is targeted at 4.4% of GDP, a reduction from the revised estimate of 4.8% in the previous fiscal year [1, 28]. Gross market borrowings are estimated at ₹14.82 lakh crore [1]. A significant portion of the expenditure, ₹11.21 lakh crore (3.1% of GDP), is earmarked for capital expenditure in FY2025-26 [1].

## Economic Growth Strategy

The budget identifies four key "engines for development": Agriculture, MSMEs, Investment, and Exports [44]. These engines are to be fueled by reforms and guided by inclusivity, with the ultimate destination being 'Viksit Bharat' [44]. The government plans transformative reforms across six domains: Taxation, Power Sector, Urban Development, Mining, Financial Sector, and Regulatory frameworks [44].

## Financial Performance

The government is estimated to spend ₹50,65,345 crore in 2025-26, marking a 7.4% increase over the revised estimate of 2024-25 [28, 29, 35, 59]. Revenue expenditure is projected to increase by 6.7%, while capital expenditure is expected to rise by 10.1% [29, 35, 59].

Government receipts (excluding borrowings) are estimated to be ₹34,96,409 crore, which is 11.1% higher than the revised estimate of 2024-25 [28, 29, 35, 59]. The revenue deficit is targeted at 1.5% of GDP, lower than the revised estimate of 1.9% for 2024-25 [28, 29, 35, 59].

The fiscal deficit is targeted at 4.4% of GDP in 2025-26, also lower than the revised estimate of 4.8% for 2024-25 [28, 29, 35, 59]. The government aims to reduce its outstanding liabilities to around 50% of GDP by March 2031; in 2025-26, these liabilities are estimated to be 56.1% of GDP [28, 29, 35].

Interest payments account for 25% of the total expenditure and 37% of revenue receipts [28, 29, 35]. The primary deficit, which is the fiscal deficit less interest payments, is estimated to be 0.8% of GDP in 2025-26 [34, 35]. The government is relying on borrowing to meet the expenditure in 2025-26 [29].

## Taxation

### Direct Tax

The budget proposes significant changes to the direct tax regime, particularly for individual income tax.

| Income Bracket (₹) | Tax Rate |
|---|---|
| 0-4 lakh | Nil |
| 4-8 lakh | 5% |
| 8-12 lakh | 10% |
| 12-16 lakh | 15% |
| 16-20 lakh | 20% |
| 20-24 lakh | 25% |
| Above 24 lakh | 30% |

Under the new tax regime, no personal income tax is payable for income up to ₹12 lakh [9, 21, 26]. This limit extends to ₹12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers due to the standard deduction of ₹75,000 [9, 21, 26]. It is estimated that the government will forgo approximately ₹1 lakh crore in direct taxes due to these changes [9, 21, 26, 31].

The limit for tax deduction on interest for senior citizens has been doubled from ₹50,000 to ₹1 lakh [10, 21, 26]. The annual limit for TDS on rent has increased to ₹6 lakh from ₹2.40 lakh [10, 21, 26]. The threshold for TCS on remittances under the RBI’s Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) has been raised from ₹7 lakh to ₹10 lakh [10, 21, 26].

The budget extends the period of incorporation for startups by 5 years, allowing startups incorporated before April 1, 2030, to avail of certain benefits [11, 22, 27]. It also extends the investment date for Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds by five more years, up to March 31, 2030, to promote funding for the infrastructure sector [11, 22, 27].

### Indirect Tax

The Union Budget 2025-26 aims to simplify the indirect tax structure by reducing the number of tariff rates, leaving only eight, including a ‘zero’ rate [12, 23, 27]. However, the total indirect tax collection is estimated to be ₹17,35,100 crore in 2025-26, with the central government estimating a collection of ₹11,78,000 crore from GST [30, 36].

The government expects to forgo approximately ₹2600 crore in indirect taxes [12, 23, 27].

Several Basic Customs Duty (BCD) exemptions and reductions have been proposed, such as: Full exemption from BCD for 36 life-saving drugs and medicines [12, 23, 27, 47].

Full exemption from BCD for Cobalt powder and waste, the scrap of lithium-ion battery, Lead, Zinc, and 12 more critical minerals [12, 23, 27, 48].

BCD on Interactive Flat Panel Display (IFPD) increased from 10% to 20% [12, 23, 27, 48].

BCD reduced to 5% on Open Cell and other components [12, 23, 27, 48].

BCD on raw materials, components, consumables, or parts for the manufacture of ships extended for another ten years [13, 23, 27, 49].

BCD reduced from 20% to 10% on Carrier Grade ethernet switches [13, 23, 27, 49].

BCD on Wet Blue leather fully exempted [13, 23, 27, 49].

BCD reduced from 30% to 5% on Frozen Fish Paste (Surimi) for manufacture and export of its analogue products [13, 23, 27, 49].

### Impact of Tax Proposals

The tax proposals are expected to have a mixed impact. The direct tax changes aim to benefit the middle class by increasing disposable income, which could boost consumption, savings, and investment [50, 51]. The indirect tax changes aim to reduce compliance burdens and promote specific industries, but the introduction of new cesses could offset some of these benefits [49].
