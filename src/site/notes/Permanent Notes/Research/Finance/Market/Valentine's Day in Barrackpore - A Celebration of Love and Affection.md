## Expressions of Love: Beyond Romantic Partners

Valentine's Day, while traditionally associated with romantic love between couples, has evolved to encompass a wider spectrum of affection. In Barrackpore, as in many places, the spirit of Valentine's Day extends to celebrating bonds with friends and family. This inclusive approach aligns with the global trend where a significant portion of people perceive Valentine’s Day as a celebration of both romantic and platonic relationships [1].  This broader interpretation fosters an environment where expressions of care are not just confined to couples but resonate throughout the community. Even in educational settings like Little Millennium Barrackpore, young children participate in Valentine's Day celebrations, expressing heartfelt love for their peers and teachers, embedding the spirit of the day from a young age [2].
